# Release Process

Gems are the Ruby equivilent of Pythons eggs and work in a similar way so this is what we'll use.

This repository only has the additional code required to transform a standard Redmine installation into a ticketing system, therefore before/whilst making the gem we must pull in all the dependencies required to make a fully fledged product. To manage this we use jenkins to perform the pre-build steps and then rubygems itself pulls in the ruby dependencies as a part of the build process.

## Initial set-up

* I followed [this tutorial](http://tecadmin.net/how-to-install-ruby-2-0-0-on-centos-6-using-rvm) to install Ruby 2.0.0, although >= 1.9.3 and rubygems should suffice.
* `yum install postgresql93 postgresql93-devel postgresql93-libs nginx libxml2-devel libxslt-devel`
* `service postgresql-9.3 start`
* `service nginx start`
* `vi /var/lib/pgsql/9.3/data/pg_hba.conf`, set localhost to trust or remember/reset the password from installation.
* `psql -U postgres -c CREATE DATABASE redmine;`
* `gem install thin`

## Demo/Test Releases

1. Run `thin stop -C /home/redmine/redmine-thin.yml`
1. Run `gem uninstall aam_lifeguard`
1. `SCP` or `wget` the aam_lifeguard gem onto the `demo-redmine-1` box. (I've been copying to `/home/redmine`)
1. Install it using `gem install aam_lifeguard.gem`.
1. Modify any settings files contained in `/home/redmine` if needed.
1. Modify the `build.sh` file if the version number of the aam_lifeguard gem has changed.
1. Run `/home/redmine/build.sh`, this will add in symlinks for the settings files to the appropriate location in the gem folder.
1. Run `thin start -C /home/redmine/redmine-thin.yml` to get Redmine to pick up the new settings.
1. Check `demo-redmine-1:3000` to make sure it's working :)
1. Relax with a cold beverage.

### Troubleshooting

The any settings files that are modified are stored under `/home/redmine` and are sym-linked to the correct mount point in the file system by the build shell script. 

* To find out where gems are installed to run: `gem env`
* I'm using 64-bit ruby on demo-redmine-1 for now, just because it was quicker than attempting to override all the 64-bit dependencies 
* The "thin" gem is required to be added to the Redmine Gemfile before it'll actually work as the web server for it. This is done as a part of build.sh.
* Might need to run: `gem install pg -- --with-pg-lib=/usr/pgsql-9.3/lib --with-pg-config=/usr/pgsql-9.3/bin/pg_config` to get the lifeguard gem to install.

## Live Releases

1. Bump the version number in `.gemspec`.
1. Tag the release: `git tag -a 1.2.3 -m "Archive 1.2.3 version of Redmine". Push the tag to GitHub: `git push upstream 1.2.3`.
1. Run the "Redmine-GemBuild" task on Jenkins (aam-ci-1:8080) and download the archived .gem file.
