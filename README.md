# Redmine

A bunch of plugins that can combine together to provide NOC tools on top of the existing issue tracker found within Redmine.

If you are looking for the SLA plugin, it can be found under `/src/plugins`, it requires the patch under `/src/core_patches` to be applied before it'll function correctly.
